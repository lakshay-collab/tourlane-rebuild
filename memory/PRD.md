# Tourlane.de Homepage Clone – PRD

## Original problem statement
Migrate/clone https://www.tourlane.de/ into Emergent as a pixel-faithful, fully responsive recreation. Scope (approved): homepage only, English copy acceptable, reuse Tourlane CDN assets, frontend-only mock first (backend migration later). Acceptance bar: designer/developer visual approval.

## Architecture
- React (CRA) + Tailwind. Backend/Mongo untouched (template only).
- `src/mock.js` – all homepage copy + asset URLs (single place to swap for API data later).
- `src/destinationsData.js` – region tabs + country cards (mirrors source data exactly).
- `src/components/*` – one component per section; `Carousel.jsx`, `SearchBar.jsx`, `TrustLine.jsx`, `Logo.jsx` shared.
- `public/*.svg` – original Tourlane SVG assets (logo path, feature icons, trust badges, Trustpilot wordmark).

## Brand re-skin (Hi Tours brand kit, 2026-06)
- Layout/backgrounds unchanged (cream surfaces kept per user). Only brand colors, fonts, logos swapped.
- Colors: primary Ember #E75E26 (hover #C84D1B), Amber #FB7F26, Peach #F4B49A (primary-container), Blush #FADDD1 (secondary-container: trust bar, step circles, arrows), Sand #FBEADB (surface-variant: table rows, active pill), Ink #002131 (text, banner, photo scrims), Harbor #174358 (secondary text, table header).
- Fonts: Bricolage Grotesque (display, weight 500), Inter (body), Instrument Sans (labels/buttons/tags).
- Logos: /public/hitours-logo.webp (header + footer), hitours-logo-white.webp (for dark use), Logo.jsx renders <img>.
- 2026-06 update: blue-first palette (primary Harbor #174358, hover Deep Harbor #113141, Sky #E0F7FF tints, Ink table header); orange Ember kept only as small accents (search pin, active trip-tab underline, newsletter icons). Hero headline: 'Discover and book customized honeymoons and holidays' (2 lines at desktop, verified 1440/1280/905; 4 lines on 390 mobile).
- 2026-06 update 2: light blues removed. Tints now Blush #FADDD1 (trust bar, arrows, active pill), Peach hover, Sand #FBEADB (table rows). Brand gradients in use: Deep Water (top banner, comparison header), Sunset Run (search 'Plan for free' + newsletter CTA buttons, hover slides gradient), Sunset line (active trip tab), Dawn Haze (step number circles). Card headlines (t-headline-*) now Bricolage Grotesque 600. Hero: 'Exquisitely crafted luxury / honeymoons and holidays' (forced 2 lines ≥905px).
- 2026-06 update 3: Hero is now a full-bleed background video (user-supplied, /public/hero-video.mp4 H.264 CRF20 ~15.5MB + hero-video.webm VP9 ~17MB, 1280x720, muted/loop/autoplay, poster hero-poster.jpg) with a light Ink scrim (30%/10%/55%), white headline + subtitle + search on top. Heights 560/600/620/680. Original 78MB upload was re-encoded for web; earlier low-quality (CRF28) version replaced after user feedback. Tourlane collage assets no longer used in hero.
- Copy still says "Tourlane" (user asked not to change anything else) – backlog item.

## Original Tourlane design tokens (reference, superseded by brand re-skin)
- Fonts: Roboto Serif (display) / Roboto Flex (body) via Google Fonts.
- Colors: primary #006D44, primary-fixed-variant #005232, secondary-container #D0E8D6, surface #FBF9F1, surface-low #F6F4EB, surface-container #F0EEE6, surface-highest #E4E3DB, surface-variant #DCE5DC, on-surface #1B1C17, on-surface-variant #404942, outline #717972, outline-variant #C0C9C0, Trustpilot #00B67A.
- Type scale utilities `.t-display-*`, `.t-headline-*`, `.t-title-*`, `.t-body-*`, `.t-label-*` in `index.css`.
- Breakpoints (Tourlane's): sm 600, md 905, lg 1280, xl 1440. Container `.tl-container` = 100% → 857 → 880 → 1128px; `.tl-wide` = max 1440.

## Implemented (2026-06)
- v1 (previous session): first approximation clone (Lora/Inter, wrong palette, missing sections).
- v2 (this session) – full rebuild to source spec:
  - Header (banner, real logo SVG, nav dividers, outlined Login, mobile drawer), non-sticky like source
  - Hero (responsive `<picture>` collage header-xs…xl with source heights/min-widths, search pill, mobile placeholder "Where to?")
  - Trustpilot bar; Features (source line-art SVG icons, mobile icon-left layout)
  - NEW "On the road with Tourlane" ambassadors card + slider
  - Comparison table (dark header, alternating cream/sage rows)
  - NEW "Unforgettable Tourlane moments" carousel (10 cards, avatar stack)
  - Steps (3 cards); Trip showcase (underline tabs, 5 trips, info panel + 5-tile mosaic with #tags)
  - Adventure band (overflowing collage images + search)
  - NEW Experts carousel (7 experts)
  - Testimonials (3-up carousel, Trustpilot stars, avatars/initials)
  - Destinations (outlined pill tabs, bordered image cards, 10 regions)
  - Newsletter band (hummingbird image, mail pill, 3 icon bullets)
  - Footer (light, 3 columns, trust badges, country selector + legal bar)
- Tested: testing agent iteration_1 – 100% pass at 390/905/1440, 0 broken images, 0 console errors.

## Egypt listing + sample product page (2026-06)
- Routes: `/afrika/aegypten` (EgyptListing.jsx, mirrors tourlane.de/afrika/aegypten/) and `/afrika/aegypten/:slug` (TourDetail.jsx, only `egypt-explorer-grand` = product 18 "Egypt Explorer — Grand Luxury Edition"; other slugs redirect to listing).
- Data: `src/egyptData.js` – 18 products (6 families × Comfort/Premium/Grand Luxury, prices from PDF), categories, places, planning/FAQ copy, full itinerary for product 18 (stops A–F, inclusions/exclusions, stats, route-at-a-glance). Images reused from Tourlane Contentful CDN.
- Shared: TourList.jsx (category tabs + cards), Breadcrumb.jsx. Homepage Africa→Egypt card links to the listing.
- Tested: iteration_5 (Egypt pages) all pass.

## Egypt pages – pixel-parity rebuild (2026-06, latest)
- Goal: make listing an exact structural copy of tourlane.de/afrika/aegypten/ and detail of .../luxor-strand-urlaub/ using PDF product 18, for backend migration comparison.
- egyptData.js rewritten: `families` (6 product cards, Tourlane card layout w/ image carousel + category chip + days/stops/price), `listingCopy` (banner, subnav, expert intro, plan, themes, faq, more-Africa), `featured` = product 18 expanded (gallery, service-included list of 8, Roman Karin expert quote, 5 route stops A-E with per-stop image galleries, stats, route-at-a-glance with hotel + highlights per day).
- EgyptListing.jsx reordered to match source: hero → sticky subnav → breadcrumb → expert (with intro para) → tours → features → testimonials → places (image overlay cards) → activities → plan cards → travel themes → FAQ → more Africa destinations → footer.
- TourDetail.jsx restructured to match source: gallery mosaic → title+meta+tag → expert quote card → sticky price card (Trustpilot + From $1,690 + Plan for free + 8 included services w/ icons) → What's included (incl/excl) → Recommended route (A-E tabs + per-stop) → Why plan with experts stats → Route at a glance timeline → features → testimonials → more tours → steps → sticky mobile CTA.
- TourList.jsx rebuilt to Tourlane card style (no category tabs); mobile carousel arrows always visible.
- Tested: iteration_6 – 100% frontend pass, 0 console errors, no overflow at 390/1920, all route tabs + carousels + FAQ + redirects verified.

## Backlog
- P1: Replace remaining 'Tourlane' brand mentions in copy with 'Hi Tours' (mock.js).
- P1: Swap English copy for German source copy if exact wording is required (all in mock.js).
- P1: Backend migration – lead/search enquiry persistence, newsletter signups (+ email provider), destinations API. Create `/app/contracts.md` first.
- P1: Detail pages for the remaining 17 products (data model already supports it – add `stops` per product).
- P2: Nav dropdown menus (Destinations / Trip types / Activities), destination detail pages, mobile Trustpilot bar variant.
- P2: Replace hotlinked Tourlane CDN assets with owned storage before production.
